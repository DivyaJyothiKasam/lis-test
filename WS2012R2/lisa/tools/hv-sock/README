This readme file contians information about building the host-end program for
hv-sock case. This case tests bidirectional connection between hosts and
guests.

*Source Files*
server_on_host.cpp
client on host.cpp

This test case and source code is originally provided by Dexuan Cui
(decui@microsoft.com) within visual studio project(Some modifications has been
made to fit in this auto case). However, building from these source code does
not rely much on the vs project itself, thus we are not bringing the whole
project into the this git repo.

Generally,it would not be difficult to build it in vs: creating a new vs
project and put the source code in, then build it. However, We do have some
recommendations about building configuration:

1. Build it with "Release" instead of "Debug"

2. Build it with "x64" instead of "x86"

3. In project property, C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library, choose
"Multi-threaded(/MT)" instead of "Multi-threaded DLL(/MD)".

These configuration recommendations are to make sure the program works
correctly on hyperv server core without extra runtime environment.

We also added the built binary executables into the repo since it would be an
overkill to require all testing hosts to install compiling environment. The
binary was built with x64 Release, static lib.
